This project is a React Native application designed 
with a focus on providing a seamless user experience through a 
bottom tab navigator and a well-organized profile management system. 
The app consists of four main screens: Home, Search, Tickets, and Profile, each accessible via the bottom tab bar.

The Profile screen is particularly detailed, displaying user information and various account options. 
Users can interact with options like "How to use Portalys," "Share the app," "Rate the app," 
"Give us your feedback," "Terms and Conditions," "Need help? Get in touch," and "Log Out." When users select "Give us your feedback," a modal appears at the bottom, 
prompting users to rate the app with a star rating system.
